# HERE Maps Community on GitHub

Examples, Demos and Custom Map Components written by the HERE Maps Coding Community 

> **NOTE** These examples are for the **deprecated 2.5.4** JavaScript API. Newer 3.x examples can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/heremaps/maps-api-for-javascript-examples) and also viewed on [jsFiddle](https://github.com/heremaps/jsfiddle-github/blob/master/README.md).
 
**Simple Examples**: A series of graduated code [examples](https://github.com/heremaps/examples/#simple-examples) using the [Maps API for JavaScript](http://developer.here.com/javascript-apis/), each example displays 
a short snippet of code with the correct syntax to do a specified task - for example _"How do I add a `Polygon` to the map?"_ Useful when getting
 started, or as an aide-memoire when writing something new.

**Advanced Examples**: A second set of [examples](https://github.com/heremaps/examples/#advanced-examples), demonstrating the use of the **advanced** features of 
the [Maps API for JavaScript](http://developer.here.com/javascript-apis/). These examples cover more difficult concepts such as
[asynchronous loading](https://github.com/heremaps/examples/#asynchronous-loading),[KML](https://github.com/heremaps/examples/#kml) and
[Map overlays](https://github.com/heremaps/examples/#overlays).

**Demos and Custom Components**:  [Demos](https://github.com/heremaps/examples/#demos-and-custom-components) showcase the power of the [Maps API for JavaScript](http://developer.here.com/javascript-apis/) when mashed up with other APIs or data sources.
Custom Components extend the basic functionality of the API to introduce new components which offer additional capabilities (such as `GeoJSON` parsing). The files 
necessary for each demo can be found in a separate directory. Each custom component also offers a demonstation of usage where the component itself can be found
within a separate `libs` directory. Obviously demos and custom components cover a very broad range of subjects, so they have been split thematically below:

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file in the root of this project for license details.
